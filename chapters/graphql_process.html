    <h3>GraphQL execution</h3>
    <p>
        Root Type represents all possible entry points into the GraphQL API.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resolver process can return (and infer) result directly if trivial. But in case of asynchronous resolvers we have to use <em>Promise</em>.
        <br>
        Each resolve function have got current object, arguments and context in params.
        <br>
        Some resolve function can be executed concurrently by GraphQL.
