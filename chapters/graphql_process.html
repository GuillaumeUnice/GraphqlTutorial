    <h3>GraphQL execution</h3>
    <p>
        Root Type represents all possible entry points into the GraphQL API.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>resolver</strong> process can return (and infer) directly trivial result. Ohterwise, in case of asynchronous resolvers we have to use <em>Promise</em>.
        <br>
        Each resolve function have got current object, potentially arguments and context in parameters.
        <br>
        Some resolve function can be executed concurrently by GraphQL.
